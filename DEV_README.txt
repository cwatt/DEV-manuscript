The following script can be used to recreate the results and figures from the manuscript.

The otu count .txt outputs were generated by the hundo pipeline created by Joe Brown (https://github.com/pnnl/hundo) 
This was copied and pasted into a .csv format which was then used in the code.

16S and ITS refer to prokaryotic and fungal data respectively.

There is an error in USEARCH which caused one of the fungal OTUs in the .txt file to be missing an OTU label. 
See "k__Fungi,p__Basidiomycota,c__Agaricomycetes,o__Agaricales,f__Inocybaceae,g__Crepidotus,s__?" in ITS_OTU.txt.
This needs to be corrected by entering OTU_2583 for that taxa, as it has been in the supplied DEVITS_otu.csv file. 
Otherwise, you won't be able to make a phyloseq object with the data and run the analyses.

Soil and Compartment refer to System and Root proximity respectively. I decided to change my labeling for the publication.

To avoid issues run these scripts for both 16S and ITS count data first, in the following order:
1. DEV_css_normalize_clean.R
2. DEV_phyloseq_prep_clean.R
3. DEV_deseq2_prep_clean.R

The other scripts can be run in whatever order you like, but require those first three to be run first.

Note: The DESeq2 package updates periodically and this can affect the outcome of the differential abundance analyses. All of the results given in the manuscript are
the results as of Nov. 2017 that runs with R version 3.3.

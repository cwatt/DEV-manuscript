The following script can be used to recreate the results and figures from the manuscript.

The otu count .txt outputs were generated by the hundo pipeline created by Joe Brown (https://github.com/pnnl/hundo) 
This was then converted to .csv format which is used for the scripts.

16S and ITS refer to prokaryotic and fungal data respectively.

There is an error in USEARCH which caused one of the fungal OTUs in the .txt file to be missing an OTU label. 
See "k__Fungi,p__Basidiomycota,c__Agaricomycetes,o__Agaricales,f__Inocybaceae,g__Crepidotus,s__?" in ITS_OTU.txt.
This needs to be corrected by entering OTU_2583 for that taxa, as it has been in the supplied DEVITS_otu.csv file. 
Otherwise, you won't be able to make a phyloseq object with the data and run the analyses.

Soil and Compartment refer to System and Root proximity respectively.
